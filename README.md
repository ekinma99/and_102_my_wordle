# Android Project 1 - *Wordle App (A Variation)*

Submitted by: **Elmiche Kinmakon**

**My_Wordle** is an android app that recreates a simple version of the popular word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **User has 3 chances to guess a random 4 letter word**
- [x] **After 3 guesses, user should no longer be able to submit another guess**
- [x] **After each guess, user sees the "correctness" of the guess**
- [x] **After all guesses are taken, user can see the target word displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can toggle betweeen different word lists
- [ ] User can see the 'correctness' of their guess through colors on the word
- [ ] User sees a visual change after guessing the correct word
- [x] User can tap a 'Reset' button to get a new word and clear previous guesses
- [ ] User will get an error message if they input an invalid guess
- [ ] User can see a 'streak' record of how many words they've guessed correctly.

## Notes
* My code at this time is very redundant.

* I would like to refactor the code, to make it more practical.

* I faced issues with the emulator working.
  * Clearing the data for the emulators helped resolve the running issues.
* I am experiencing a bug where the guess and the correct word is not compared correctly as a result the output of the checkGuess function is not displaying the correct result of the guesses.
* Would like to improve the aligment of the UI.
